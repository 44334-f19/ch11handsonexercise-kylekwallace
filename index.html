<h1>Fact 3:</h1>
<p>Digital Millennium Copyright Act</p>
<p>The Digital Millennium Copyright Act removes liability from websites whose users commit copyright infringement, as long as the websites take the material down. This means that even if YouTube or Facebook allows you to upload something on your small business page, you could still be committing copyright infringement and the material can be removed.(Thompson, 2018)</p>

<h1>Fact 4:</h1>    
<p>The first copyright law was created in the 18th century: the British Statute of Anne 1710. Passed to protect the rights of authors, the statute required them to renew their copyright every two years. If you didn’t renew, your work went into the public domain, and any printer could profit from it.(Engel, 2018)</p>

<h1>Fact 5:</h1>    
<p>Copyright protection is important because, without it, those who spend countless hours creating their intellectual works can be exploited by anyone and their works can be used by these people for their own commercial gain which is unfair for those who created it. (Alex, 2017)</p>
